# UX 
## Users and User Stories

This project was designed to allow users to, through CRUD functionality, create read update delete , shopping bag orders, product reviews, forum posts, forum post comments, and the ability to sign up to a newsletter and send a message to the site owners via the contact us form via the navigation menu.

### Admin Users
This project was designed to create an online ecommerce store where the site owners have the functionality to create read update and delete, products, product categories, manufacturer categories, forum topics, forum categories, forum posts and forum comments. 
To restrict the type of content displayed on this website any comments or posts or reviews created by a site user, will be sent to the administrator for verification prior to being published. Should a user update a post, comment, review, the status is reset and the post, comment or review, is resent to the administrator for a further approval prior to publishment. 

Any actions carried out by a site user or administrator are accompanied with messages to inform the user of the tasks and their status. 

The administrator has a seperate admin panel, which is not visible to regular site users, to carry out their day to day tasks which can be seen in the images below. The administration panel allows the storeowner to easily navigate via stock control, newsletter subscribers, contact us messages and manufacturer and category lists with further crud functionality to allow the siteowner full unrestricted access to the tasks they may require. 


This website is designed for the regular everyday individuals, however it caters for the motorsport enthusiast and due to the forum, would cater for all types of motor enthusiast, and allows the users to interact and share the knowledge they have gained. The forum has a classified section where users can trade used goods and can advertise for vehicles and parts wanted. 

The forum has a seperate forum admin menu which is not visible to regular site users where the siteowners have access to forms to create forum categories and topics. The Administartor also has edit and delete functionality avilable at the forum topic and ategory headings, which is not visible to the regular users.

The Color scheme throughout the website is based on an orange and black color scheme as the colors are very different giving the user clear visiblity throughout the website. We have also opted to use larer images for better visiblilty of the products on offer so the user can visibly see the product clearly prior to selectin to purchase it. 

I feel that this website satisfies the base requirements in that the users can create, read, update and delete data related to items in the database in an easy to use and visually appealing interface. 

There are a range of apps including shopping bag, checkout, contact us, favourites, forum, home, media, newsletter, product reviews, products, profiles and storeowners that all work together seamlessly to provide a beautifully designed and easy to navigate website that has been designed to appeal to a wide range of users. 

A new user who does not have an account will have access to the homepage (index.html) and to the store, and has limited functionality such as the newsletter optin, and the contact us messenger the signup page, and the login page. They will be unable to access the forum or create reviews or comments on the existing reviews, and should the user attempt to navigate to the forum, they will be redirected to the sign in page, which also offers a link to sign up.  

Once logged in, the members will have access to the sites remaining functionality for creating reviews, commenting and liking reviews, the forum topics, categories, posts and comments and will allow the editing and deleting of reviews,comments and editing content on their personal profile. 

In regards to the contact us messenging service, should an unregistered user wish to contact the administrator, a form is displayed with numerous fields such as the users address and personal details which is added to the database for future reference. A registed user has simply a message text box displayed as the users information will already be on file.

<br>



### Unregistered and Registered Users
        - There are two main user types,
            - An admin(administrator) user account has been set up with username/password of testuseradmin/testpassword
            - A regular(shopper) user account has been set up with username/password of testuser/testpassword
            - When making a payment as a regular user, a test credit card of 4242424242424242 has been set up for the card number
            - For the expiry date, cvc and postal code please input 0424 242424
 
Once logged in, staff members have access to the same functionality as members and additonal functionality which is not made available to a regular user for testing purposes and to maintain stock control etc. The staff status allows selected users to access the management area where staff can view all products, categories, manufacturers, newsletter subscribers and contact us messages sent by site users to administration, and allows access to the django administration area where the staff member can view all products, orders, newsletter subscribers, forum categories, reviews, comments, users etc and has administration priveledges which allows them to create edit and update reviews, comments, bookings, users etc. The administration area is required in order to publish posts, comments, reviews etc, which have been submitted for approval prior to getting published.

### Manual Testing

During this process, several issues were discovered and some of which have been since fixed on the site. Some examples of these include;

- The original version of the website allowed users to create product reviews for the seleted products and each review had the ability for users like/unlike the specific reviews, and to create comments and like/unlike the comments. During the early stages of development this functinality was functioning as intended and a review could be created, any user could like/unlike the review, the users could alos create comments on the review and they could like/unlike the comments. For any of the reviews or comments that were liked, if the current user had previously selected to like the review/comment, the heart symbol would turn red and if unliked would turn white. Near the end of developing this application, during manual testing of the site it became apparrant that there was an issue with the logic relating to this. The issue was that the query in the view was querying for a single review in order to display the comments relating to that review and when more than one review was returned an error would arise as the multiple results required itertion in the template and the template was not set up for this. the template was set up for displaying a single instance so when i changed it to suit a multiple response it would throw an error then when a single response or no response was returned from the query. Due to time constraints i had to remove this functionality from the application, but will be implementing it in a future updated version.

- In the shopping bag app and checkout appit was noted that although following the guidelines set out in the boutique ado walkthrough, the order does not appear to be adding items by size and quantity, and if a product is selected and multiple sizes or a quantity higher than 1 then the order does not calculate this and only one item is added. Due to time constratints i have not been able to pinpoint the fault which causes this issue, however this would be a future upate to be added to this application.

- In the forum app, the user has the ability to like and unlike comments, and the toggler is functioning correctly as it is correctly incrementing or decrementing the number of likes, however the red heart icon does change color depending on the current users preferences and due to time constraints this bug will need rectificatin in a future update.

- During manual testing numerous visual errors came to light and the majority of which have been rectified, however some of minor errors still exist, relating to the page width and elements not spanning the full width of the document or the document overflowing beyomd the viewport width.

There are other issues that could not be fixed due to ability / time contraints that have been included in the "Bugs Found" section below.

### Validation
<hr>

#### HTML

All HTML pages have been checked using the W3C Markup Validation Service. Some Errors were found in the Edit_profile.html page which relate to the fields automaticaly rendered using crispy forms.

Some of the page urls were raising a 500 error when the validator attempted to test the page, however to avoid this, the page source code was used for testing, however the tool pointed to several small issues on some pages that were of no consequence, such as opening p tags not being found for a closing /p tag, when they were present in the code, however these issues only related to the crispy forms mentioned above.

Please see the w3c-validation.md file for the full breakdown of the HTML W3C validation testing done for this site. You can click[**here**](./README/w3c_validation.md) to reach the file. 


#### CSS
The custom.css file code was validated using the The W3C CSS Validation Service and the image below verifies that the code was successfully validated with no errors. Numerous warnings were noted which relate to the bootstrap CSS files inherited with the template, however none of the custom css written for this web application failed or had any warnings present.

All CSS files have been tested and the results of which can be found by clicking [**here**](https://github.com/BrianStritch/Brian-Stritch-P5-BS_Auto_parts/blob/main/README/w3c_validation.md) to reach the file.

#### PYTHON 

The automated tool yapf has been used to assist in the erradification of linting errors in the python files throughout this application.

All python files have been tested using pep8 online testing platform and all errors have been removed and pep8 testing has passed.
Please see the pep8 testing file for the full breakdown of the pep8 testing done for this site. You can click [**here**](https://github.com/BrianStritch/Brian-Stritch-P5-BS_Auto_parts/blob/main/README/pep8.md) to reach the file.

### Automated
#### Django / Coverage
Django tests were written and Coverage was used to product detailed reports to ensure the sites apps were tested as much as possible. On testing the applicatin with coverage it was noted that an overall score of 85% was obtained.

1. In the terminal, use: "coverage report"
    - generates a detailed report showing what has/what needs testing

2. In order to product a html report which allows you to inspect in each file, to see in easy to use colour codes the lines of code which have been tested or which have not yet been tested, please use the following command: "coverage html"

#### Unittest
In order to run tests on GitPod using unittest (which has been installed to handle testing), please follow the below steps in the terminal on GitPod:

1. In BS_Auto_parts settings.py the database needs to be switched to the local database as the tests will not run when on the heroku postgres database. The loal database is kept in commented out form to allow switching of the database for testing purposes.

2. Run the following code : "pyhton3 manage.py test"
    - This will run a test on all test.py files in the app and will display in the terminal if all tests are passing, and if it does not it will show the error causing the test to fail.

### Python
All python code pages have been tested to ensure it meets PEP8 standards and the results of which can be found by clicking [**here**]() to reach the file. 

### Accessibility
All HTML pages have been tested for accessibility and performance using Chrome Devtools Lighthouse testing platform and the results of which can be found by clicking [**here**](https://github.com/BrianStritch/Brian-Stritch-P5-BS_Auto_parts/blob/main/README/accessibility_tests.md) to reach the file. 

### Responsiveness
This website has been designed to scale correctly to different screen sizes with no issues on layout. In order to ensure that the view was pleasant to the user, certain divs and items had to be arranged differently or hidden/shown depending on screen size. This was handled using CSS media queries. Click [**here**](https://github.com/BrianStritch/Brian-Stritch-P5-BS_Auto_parts/blob/main/README/responsive_testing.md) to see images of the application on different sized media screens.

### Bugs Found
- The original version of the website allowed users to create product reviews for the seleted products and each review had the ability for users like/unlike the specific reviews, and to create comments and like/unlike the comments. During the early stages of development this functinality was functioning as intended and a review could be created, any user could like/unlike the review, the users could alos create comments on the review and they could like/unlike the comments. For any of the reviews or comments that were liked, if the current user had previously selected to like the review/comment, the heart symbol would turn red and if unliked would turn white. Near the end of developing this application, during manual testing of the site it became apparrant that there was an issue with the logic relating to this. The issue was that the query in the view was querying for a single review in order to display the comments relating to that review and when more than one review was returned an error would arise as the multiple results required itertion in the template and the template was not set up for this. the template was set up for displaying a single instance so when i changed it to suit a multiple response it would throw an error then when a single response or no response was returned from the query. Due to time constraints i had to remove this functionality from the application, but will be implementing it in a future updated version.

- In the shopping bag app and checkout appit was noted that although following the guidelines set out in the boutique ado walkthrough, the order does not appear to be adding items by size and quantity, and if a product is selected and multiple sizes or a quantity higher than 1 then the order does not calculate this and only one item is added. Due to time constratints i have not been able to pinpoint the fault which causes this issue, however this would be a future upate to be added to this application.

- In the forum app, the user has the ability to like and unlike comments, and the toggler is functioning correctly as it is correctly incrementing or decrementing the number of likes, however the red heart icon does change color depending on the current users preferences and due to time constraints this bug will need rectificatin in a future update.
